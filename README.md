# Crop-Monitoring 🌱🛰️

---

## 📖 Overview

Welcome to the **Crop-Monitoring** project! This repository contains a powerful, automated pipeline for monitoring agricultural areas using satellite imagery and climate data. By leveraging a serverless AWS architecture and a CI/CD workflow, this project provides timely and scalable analysis of crop health, enabling data-driven decisions for farmers, agronomists, and researchers.

The core of the system is an AWS Lambda function that processes satellite data for a given Area of Interest (AOI), which is then used in downstream analysis scripts that can integrate other data sources, like climate information.

## ✨ Key Features

*   🛰️ **Satellite Data Processing**: Automatically fetches and processes satellite imagery for specified regions.
*   ☁️ **Serverless Architecture**: Built on AWS Lambda for cost-effective, scalable, and event-driven computation.
*   📊 **In-depth Analysis**: Includes scripts for analyzing processed data and integrating climate metrics.
*   🤖 **CI/CD Automation**: Deploys infrastructure and code automatically using GitHub Actions upon every push to the `main` branch.
*   🗺️ **GeoJSON-based AOI**: Easily define your Area of Interest using a standard `aoi.geojson` file.
*   🏗️ **Infrastructure as Code**: The AWS infrastructure (IAM roles, Lambda functions, etc.) is managed and versioned within the `infrastructure` directory.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8 or later
*   An AWS Account and configured AWS CLI with appropriate permissions.
*   Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Crop-Monitoring.git
    cd Crop-Monitoring
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    # For Unix/macOS
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Project

This project is designed to be deployed via a CI/CD pipeline. The primary way to "run" it is to push changes to the `main` branch, which will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the infrastructure and Lambda function to your AWS account.

To run analysis scripts locally:

```sh
# Navigate to the analysis directory
cd analysis/

# Run a specific analysis script
python aws_analysis.py
```
